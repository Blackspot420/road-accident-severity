# Accident Severity Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project uses a manually created dataset to train a Linear Regression model that predicts the **severity of a road accident** based on various factors like weather, road condition, vehicle speed, and more.

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Weather_Condition** (e.g., Clear, Rainy, Fog)
- **Road_Surface_Condition** (Dry or Wet)
- **Vehicle_Speed** (in km/h)
- **Light_Condition** (Daylight or Darkness)
- **Number_of_Vehicles** involved
- **Driver_Age**
- **Accident_Severity** (1=Slight, 2=Serious, 3=Fatal)

##  Model Details

- **Model Used**: Linear Regression
- **Tool**: Python (Google Colab)
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `joblib`
- **Model Output**: `accident_severity_model.pkl`

---

## Purpose

The goal of this model is to analyze traffic accident conditions and **predict how severe an accident might be**. This can support traffic safety strategies in developing countries.
